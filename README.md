# INTRODUCTION:
Hi there, I created my first React App which covers Medium Level Understanding of REACT.

# WHAT'S IN THE APP:
1- It's an expense Tracking App Which takes Details from the user like Expense Item, Date and Amount of that Expense.

2- The App then add That Expense Data in the form of List where we can also search Our Expense Based on the Desired Year... :)

# TOPICS COVERED:

1- Custom Components
2- Data Transfer Between Components ( Using Props)
3- Working With Statesc(Single and Multivariable state)
4- List Filtering
5- Forms 


# IMPORTANT:

I'm still Working on this Project and will soon add more features in App.
